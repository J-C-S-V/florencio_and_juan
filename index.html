                <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.

            <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement
                interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>

            <h1>JavaScript and Java</h1>
            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax,
                naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>

            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
            <p style="  font-family: monospace
            ">function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); } greetMe("World");
            </p>
            <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!

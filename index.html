            Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
            objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
            For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
            elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
            clicks, form input, and page navigation.

        <p>
          JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
          have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
          to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
          protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
          parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

      <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
        <header>Hello world</header>
        <p>
          To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
          your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
        </p>
        <code>
          function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
          greetMe("World");
        </code>
        <p>
          Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
          browser!
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>
          You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
          The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
          dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
          Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
          "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
          (lowercase).
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
          identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
          characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
          Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

      <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
        <header>Declaring variables</header>
        <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
        <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
        <code> var x = 42. </code>
        <p>
          This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
        </p>
        <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
        <code> x = 42. </code>
        <p>
          This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict
          JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
        </p>
        <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
        <code> let y = 13.</code>
        <p>
          This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See
          Variable scope below.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
        <header>Variable scope</header>

        <p>
          When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
          global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
          current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
          called a local variable, because it is available only within that
          function.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope;
          rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function
          (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the
          following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or
          global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in
          this case is an if statement.
        </p>
        <code> if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5 </code>
        <p>
          This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
          ECMAScript 2015.
        </p>
        <code>
          if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is<br />
          not defined
        </code>
